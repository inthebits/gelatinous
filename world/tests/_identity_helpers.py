"""
Shared identity-test helpers.

Centralises the derivation of recognition_memory dict keys and the
shape of recognition_memory entries so the 7 identity-adjacent test
modules (``test_identity_commands``, ``test_emote``, ``test_emote_templates``,
``test_identity_search``, ``test_communication``, ``test_character_identity``,
``test_identity``) stay aligned with the production engine in
``world/identity.py``.

Two reasons to import from here instead of seeding literal UIDs:

1. **Schema stability.**  When the identity signature gains new inputs
   (e.g. PR-C wires equipped essential disguise items), every test
   re-derives its expected key automatically.

2. **Mock hygiene.**  ``MagicMock(spec=Character)`` auto-creates truthy
   stand-ins for ``char.db.height_override`` etc., which silently
   poisons the signature.  :func:`prepare_mock_for_apparent_uid` clears
   those axes to ``None`` so the derived UID is a deterministic function
   of ``sleeve_uid`` alone (until PR-C adds essential items).
