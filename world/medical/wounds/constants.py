    Get the display name for a body location based on character's species.

    PR-G: delegates to :func:`world.anatomy.get_species_location_display`
    so naming stays consistent with severed limbs, organs, and corpses.
    The previous ``character.location_display_names`` per-instance
    override branch was dead code (no production code path ever set
    the attribute) and has been removed.

    Args:
        location (str): Body location key
        character: Character object (optional) — used to read
            ``db.species``; falls back to ``"human"`` when absent.
