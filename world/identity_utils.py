Identity-Aware Messaging Utilities

Helper functions for sending per-observer identity-resolved messages.
The primary entry point is :func:`msg_room_identity`, which replaces
direct ``msg_contents()`` calls for any message that references
characters by name.

See specs/IDENTITY_RECOGNITION_SPEC.md §msg_room_identity Helper for
the full specification.

    """Send an identity-aware message to all observers in a room.

    Each observer receives a personalised copy of *template* where
    ``{placeholder}`` tokens are replaced with the referenced
    character's display name as seen **by that specific observer**.

    Args:
        location: The room to broadcast in.
        template: Message string with ``{placeholder}`` tokens that
            correspond to keys in *char_refs*.
            Example: ``"{actor} attacks {target} with a knife!"``
        char_refs: Mapping of placeholder names to Character objects.
            Example: ``{"actor": attacker, "target": target}``
        exclude: Characters/objects to exclude from receiving the
            message.  Typically the actor and/or target who receive
            separate first-person messages.
        pre_resolved_refs: Optional pre-computed display-name snapshots,
            shaped ``{placeholder: {observer: display_name_str}}``.
            When an observer has an entry under a placeholder, that
            string is used verbatim instead of calling
            ``char.get_display_name(observer)``.  This is the snapshot
            idiom used by actions whose effect mutates the actor's own
            sdesc inputs (e.g. putting on a disguise item) — the
            command captures pre-mutation names *before* mutating
            state, then passes them here so the broadcast describes
            the actor as they appeared at the moment they began the
            action.  See specs/IDENTITY_RECOGNITION_SPEC.md
            §"Action Broadcast Sdesc Stability".  Missing placeholder
            keys or missing observer keys silently fall through to
            the live ``get_display_name`` lookup.
        **kwargs: Extra keyword arguments passed through to each
            ``observer.msg()`` call (e.g. ``type="say"``).

    Example::

        msg_room_identity(
            location=room,
            template="{actor} attacks {target} with a knife!",
            char_refs={"actor": attacker, "target": target},
            exclude=[attacker, target],
