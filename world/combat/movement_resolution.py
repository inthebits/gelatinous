Movement Resolution Module

Standalone functions for resolving movement-related combat actions
(retreat, advance, charge) within the combat handler.

Extracted from CombatHandler to reduce handler.py size and improve
modularity.

All functions take ``handler`` as their first parameter (the CombatHandler
script instance) instead of operating as methods on the class.
