        Looters and bystanders who already remember the deceased should
        continue to see the assigned name on the corpse, exactly as
        they would on the living character.  The lookup mirrors
        :meth:`typeclasses.characters.Character.get_display_name`:

        * ``looker is None`` (system context) → decay-stage fallback.
        * Stage is ``skeletal`` → decay-stage name (hard cutoff;
          neither natural recognition nor a forensic skill check can
          recover an identity from bones; recognizable clothing is
          deduced by the player through item inspection, not surfaced
          through the corpse name).
        * Otherwise, two-pass recognition:

          1. **Natural recognition.**  Compute the *decay-degraded*
             apparent UID via :func:`world.identity.get_apparent_uid_for_decay`
             (which blanks the body-identity axis at ``moderate`` and
             ``advanced`` stages).  If the looker's memory has that UID,
             return its ``assigned_name``.  At ``fresh`` and ``early``
             the degraded UID equals the fresh UID, so this path covers
             ordinary recognition through light decay.
          2. **Forensic recovery.**  If the degraded lookup missed,
             compute the *fresh-equivalent* UID via
             :func:`world.identity.get_apparent_uid`.  If memory has
             that UID **and** the looker passes an Intellect roll
             against the stage DC (see :meth:`_attempt_forensic_recognition`),
             return its ``assigned_name``.  The roll outcome is cached
             permanently per ``(looker, this corpse)``.

        * Else → decay-stage name (``"fresh corpse"`` etc.).

        Disguise loss after death is handled by re-reading the
        signature on every call (no cache): once a disguise-essential
        item is looted, both UID computations see the new
        ``get_worn_items()`` view and the recognition match silently
