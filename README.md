# Gelatinous

A text-based multiplayer game built on the [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/) MUD framework. Gelatinous implements a tactical turn-based combat system with proximity mechanics, grappling, medical trauma simulation, and messaging systems designed to prioritize storytelling.

**Live Instance**: [https://gel.monster](https://gel.monster)  
**Telnet**: play.gel.monster:23

## Overview

Gelatinous is a pre-alpha MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) that explores tactical combat design with a focus on narrative depth. The game features the G.R.I.M. system (Grit, Resonance, Intellect, Motorics) - a four-attribute framework governing character capabilities in combat, social interactions, and skill resolution.

### Core Features

- **Turn-Based Tactical Combat**: Initiative-driven combat system with 6-second rounds
- **Proximity System**: Melee/ranged positioning with tactical movement commands (advance, retreat, charge, flee)
- **Grappling Mechanics**: Multi-participant restraint system with contested rolls, dragging, and human shield functionality
- **Medical Simulation**: Wound tracking, bleeding mechanics, pain management, and recovery systems
- **Projectile Physics**: Cross-room throwing with flight timing, trajectory calculation, and interception mechanics
- **Environmental Interaction**: Trap rigging, graffiti system, crowd dynamics, and weather effects
- **Equipment Systems**: Layered clothing with armor values, weapon wielding, and inventory consolidation
- **Shop System**: Prototype-based shops with infinite/limited inventory and merchant NPCs
- **Death & Corpses**: Death progression system with forensic corpses and decay mechanics
- **Object Interaction**: Wrest command for contested item acquisition, frisk for searching
- **Consumption System**: Eating, drinking, and substance effects
- **Bug Reporting**: In-game bug reporting command
- **Natural Language Processing**: Ordinal number recognition and flexible command parsing
- **Atmospheric Messaging**: 95+ weapon-specific message templates with three-perspective combat narration

### G.R.I.M. Attribute System

- **Grit**: Physical toughness, endurance, and raw strength
- **Resonance**: Social awareness, empathy, and interpersonal skills
- **Intellect**: Mental acuity, tactical thinking, and problem-solving
- **Motorics**: Physical coordination, dexterity, and reflexes

These attributes drive contested rolls, skill checks, and combat resolution throughout the game.

## Quick Start

**Connect**: [https://gel.monster](https://gel.monster) or `telnet play.gel.monster 23`

**Local Development**: Requires [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Setup/Installation.html). Standard `evennia migrate` and `evennia start` workflow.

### Key Systems

**Combat**: Turn-based Script-driven handler with initiative order, opposed rolls, and 6-second rounds. See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for comprehensive architecture.

**Proximity**: Tactical positioning distinguishing melee/ranged engagement with movement commands (advance, retreat, charge, flee).

**Grappling**: Multi-participant restraint with contested rolls, dragging, takeover mechanics, and human shield functionality.

**Medical**: Wound severity tracking, bleeding accumulation, pain effects, and treatment requirements.

**Messages**: 95+ weapon-specific templates with three-perspective narration (attacker, victim, observer) and dynamic content loading.

**Death & Corpses**: Death progression system managing unconsciousness, death state, and corpse creation with forensic data preservation and just-in-time decay calculations.

**Shops**: Prototype-based shop system supporting infinite/limited inventory, dynamic pricing with markup, and merchant NPC integration.
