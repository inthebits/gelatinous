# Gelatinous

A text-based multiplayer game built on the [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/) MUD framework. Gelatinous implements a tactical turn-based combat system with proximity mechanics, grappling, medical trauma simulation, and messaging systems designed to prioritize storytelling.

**Live Instance**: [https://gel.monster](https://gel.monster)

## Overview

Gelatinous is a pre-alpha MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) that explores tactical combat design with a focus on narrative depth. The game features the G.R.I.M. system (Grit, Resonance, Intellect, Motorics) -- a four-attribute framework governing character capabilities in combat, social interactions, and skill resolution.

The current setting is a sci-fi offworld colony, though the codebase is designed to be setting-agnostic.

### G.R.I.M. Attribute System

| Attribute | Governs |
|-----------|---------|
| **Grit** | Physical toughness, endurance, raw strength |
| **Resonance** | Social awareness, empathy, interpersonal influence |
| **Intellect** | Mental acuity, tactical thinking, problem-solving |
| **Motorics** | Physical coordination, dexterity, reflexes |

These attributes drive contested rolls, skill checks, and combat resolution throughout the game.

### Core Features

- **Turn-Based Tactical Combat** -- Initiative-driven system with 6-second rounds
- **Proximity System** -- Melee/ranged positioning with movement commands (advance, retreat, charge, flee)
- **Grappling Mechanics** -- Multi-participant restraint system with contested rolls, dragging, and human shield functionality
- **Medical Simulation** -- Organ-level wound tracking, bleeding mechanics, pain management, bone anatomy, and recovery systems
- **Projectile Physics** -- Cross-room throwing with flight timing, trajectory calculation, and interception
- **Explosives** -- Grenade and explosive device systems with blast radius and shrapnel
- **Environmental Interaction** -- Trap rigging, graffiti system, crowd dynamics, and weather effects
- **Equipment Systems** -- Layered clothing with armor values, weapon wielding, and inventory consolidation
- **Shop System** -- Prototype-based shops with infinite/limited inventory and merchant NPCs
- **Death and Corpses** -- Death progression system with forensic corpses, decay mechanics, and curtain-of-death boundary
- **Object Interaction** -- Wrest command for contested item acquisition, frisk for searching
- **Consumption System** -- Eating, drinking, and substance effects
- **96 Weapon Message Templates** -- Three-perspective combat narration (attacker, victim, observer) per weapon type
- **GMCP WebSocket** -- Custom WebSocket handler speaking GMCP wire format for MUD client compatibility
- **Web Authentication** -- Email-based login, Discourse SSO integration, Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA
- **Identity & Recognition** -- Sleeve-based physical identity with short descriptions, stranger perception, manual name assignment, and custom keyword catalog
- **Emote, Pose & Communication** -- Dot-pose engine, traditional emote with character references, identity-aware say/whisper, social templates, and perspective-transformed pronouns
- **Grammar Engine** -- Third-person verb conjugation, article selection (a/an), first-letter capitalization, and sdesc keyword validation
- **Natural Language Parsing** -- Ordinal number recognition and flexible command parsing

## Quick Start

**Play**: [https://gel.monster](https://gel.monster)

**Local Development**: Requires [Evennia](https://www.evennia.com/docs/latest/Setup/Installation.html). Standard `evennia migrate` and `evennia start` workflow. The game uses a debug channel called Splattercast which requires manual creation at this time.

## Architecture

The codebase follows Evennia's standard structure with custom extensions for combat, medical, environmental, and web systems.

### Key Systems

**Combat** -- Turn-based Script-driven handler with initiative order, opposed rolls, and 6-second rounds. The combat system was decomposed from monolithic files into focused modules: `handler.py` orchestrates turns, `attack.py` resolves hits, `actions.py` processes queued actions, `movement_resolution.py` handles tactical movement, `proximity.py` manages melee/ranged positioning, and `grappling.py` handles restraint mechanics. All constants are centralized in `constants.py` with no magic strings.

**Medical** -- Hospital-grade anatomical simulation with individual bone tracking (humerus, femur, tibia, metacarpals), organ systems with HP and functionality, body capacities (consciousness, blood pumping, breathing, manipulation), wound severity tracking, bleeding accumulation, pain effects, and death from organ failure or blood loss.

**Messages** -- 96 weapon-specific template files with three-perspective narration (attacker, victim, observer) and dynamic content loading. Messages are organized by combat phase (initiate, hit, miss, kill) with multiple random variants per phase.

**Death and Corpses** -- Death progression system managing unconsciousness, death state, and corpse creation with forensic data preservation. Corpses use just-in-time decay calculations. The curtain-of-death exit provides a narrative boundary for the death experience.

**Character Architecture** -- The Character typeclass uses a mixin decomposition pattern: `armor_mixin.py` handles armor calculation, `clothing_mixin.py` manages wear/remove logic, and `appearance_mixin.py` builds longdesc from wounds, clothing, and equipment. This keeps `characters.py` focused on core G.R.I.M. stats and combat integration.

**Shops** -- Prototype-based shop system supporting infinite/limited inventory, dynamic pricing with markup, and merchant NPC integration.

**GMCP WebSocket** -- Custom WebSocket protocol handler (`server/conf/gmcp_websocket.py`) that speaks GMCP wire format when clients negotiate the `gmcp.mudstandards.org` subprotocol, with fallback to Evennia's standard JSON protocol for browser clients. Sends game text as BINARY frames with ANSI escape codes and OOB data as TEXT frames.

**Web and Authentication** -- Email-based login system replacing Evennia's default username auth. Includes Discourse SSO for forum integration, Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA for registration, and a security middleware chain (CSP headers, X-Frame-Options, SecurityMiddleware).

**Identity & Recognition** -- Sleeve-based physical identity system where characters appear as short descriptions ("a lanky man in a leather jacket") to strangers. Players manually assign names to recognized characters via `assign <target> as <name>`. Short descriptions are composed from auto-derived physical descriptors (height x build table), player-selected keywords (curated list or custom words), and auto-derived distinguishing features (wielded weapons, clothing, hair). Recognition memory is stored per `sleeve_uid` for flash-clone compatibility. The `@shortdesc` command manages keyword selection, with a `CustomKeywordCatalog` tracking novel custom keywords. Identity-aware `get_display_name()` renders assigned names for recognized characters and sdescs for strangers across all game output.

**Communication** -- Identity-aware emote, pose, and communication system. Dot-pose (`.emote`) provides a full tokenizer with verb markers, pronoun tokens, speech blocks, and character references that resolve to identity-appropriate names per observer. Traditional emote supports character reference resolution. Say and whisper commands render speaker identity per-observer. Social templates provide room-wide narrative actions. The grammar engine handles third-person verb conjugation, a/an article selection, and first-letter capitalization.

### Design Principles

- **Roleplay-First Combat** -- Combat enhances narrative rather than dominating it. Auto-yielding mechanics default to non-violent resolution. Tie-breaking favors the defender.
- **Modular Architecture** -- Each system aspect lives in focused modules with clear responsibilities. Loose coupling through well-defined interfaces.
- **Evennia-Native** -- Leverages Evennia's typeclass system, Script handlers, Command patterns, and attribute storage. No reinvention of platform capabilities.
- **Constants Centralization** -- No magic strings. All combat and medical constants live in dedicated `constants.py` files.
- **Setting-Agnostic Core** -- The G.R.I.M. system and combat mechanics are designed to work across settings. The current sci-fi colony is one implementation.
