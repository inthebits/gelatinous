"""
Identity-aware character target resolution for commands.

Centralises the two non-trivial targeting patterns that the
identity-recognition system imposes on commands:

1. **Same-room character lookup** with proper identity filtering and
   Builder-by-key fallback within the candidate scope.  Use
   :func:`resolve_character_target`.

2. **Cross-room scan** across an explicit list of rooms (typically a
   combat handler's ``managed_rooms``).  Use
   :func:`resolve_character_in_rooms`.

3. **Admin dual-path** — local identity match first, then a global
   key-based search as fallback so staff retain cross-room reach.  Use
   :func:`resolve_admin_target`.

This module is the canonical entry point referenced by
``specs/IDENTITY_RECOGNITION_SPEC.md`` §Command Authoring Rule.  New
commands SHOULD prefer these helpers over hand-rolled substring loops
or ``caller.search(name, location=..., candidates=...)`` patterns,
both of which bypass the identity filter (see
``typeclasses/characters.py:1201–1206``).

All helpers handle the magic ``me`` / ``self`` / ``myself`` tokens by
returning the caller directly when ``allow_self=True``; otherwise they
return ``None`` so the calling command can emit a cannot-target-self
message in its own voice.
